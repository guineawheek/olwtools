pRadius - Installation intructions
=======================================================================

There is no makefile for now. This will be arrenged in later versions.

3-steps installation :
 - copy pRadius.pm in /usr/lib/perl5
 - copy radius.cgi in your cgi-bin directory and chmod +x it.
 - set suid to redius.cgi

I strongly advise to protect radius.cgi with an .htaccess file.
