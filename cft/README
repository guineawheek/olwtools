cft - Create From Template


cft is a very handy tool to create new files from a template. It is specialy 
designed for text files like sources codes, but you can use it for anything 
else.


INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

Type 'make install' as root. You may change the installation path by typing 
something like 'PREFIX=/usr make install'.

I recommand you to edit the 'editor' file before installing. Just put the name 
of your favorite text editor in it. You may still modify it later.
